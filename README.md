# T-64B-Mod

This mod was created in collaboration with Atlas, Github: (https://github.com/thebeninator).
Use of any aspect of this mod is not for use in the development of any other mod unless permissed by the creator.
How to install:

1. Requires MelonLoader, instructions for download here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LbIHolAu5CE at roughly 0:34. Melonloader is found on github through a simple search.
2. Download the .dll from the latest release. Do not report bugs about previous releases.
3. Drop the .dll in the mod folder of your GHPC game.
4. Run the .exe directly from the game directory. **IT WILL NOT WORK THORUGH STEAM!**

This mod will replace the T-64A with a T-64B, keep in mind that the model is unable to be changed at the moment, so you will need to use your imagination for now.
For questions, contact me in the GHPC discord under my username SwissAdmiral in the dedicated forum post for the mod.
